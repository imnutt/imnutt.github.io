This is a story about a book from the *Bibliophile* series—a gem that is quite hard to find these days. I had been scouting bookstores for a while before I stumbled upon it: **"Time Was Soft There: A Paris Sojourn at Shakespeare & Co."** It’s an old soul, first published around 2005.

The first used copy I found was priced at 700 Baht. At that moment, I hesitated and didn't pull the trigger because I still had *The Readers of Broken Wheel Recommend* waiting on my bedside table.

**A Lesson Learned:** I told myself that if I couldn't find another copy, I’d eventually pay the premium. But when I finally went back for it, someone else had already snatched it up. Honestly, I felt a mix of regret and a strange sense of joy, knowing someone else shared my taste for these rare finds. Fortunately, I later found another copy from a different shop at a much friendlier price.

### An Ex-Journalist’s Refuge in the Heart of Paris

Written by **Jeremy Mercer**, this memoir recounts his life while living and working at **Shakespeare & Co.**, the legendary Parisian bookstore that has been a sanctuary for writers since 1951.

Jeremy’s journey began under grim circumstances. Formerly a crime reporter in Canada, an unexpected turn of events forced him to leave his job and flee to Paris. With his savings dwindling and hope fading, he walked into Shakespeare & Co. just to buy a book.

The staff invited him for tea and told him something incredible: this place welcomes writers, poets, and creators to stay for free. The very next day, he moved in and began assisting **George Whitman**, the kind-hearted proprietor who was 86 at the time.

### George Whitman: "Give what you can, take what you need"

George might have seemed eccentric to some, but to those who truly knew him, he was a pillar of the literary community. His life philosophy was simple yet profound: **“Give what you can, take what you need.”**

While guests stayed for free, George asked for small contributions in return—helping out around the shop, cleaning, or organizing shelves. Jeremy experienced a life that was far from luxurious, yet deeply fulfilling. He lived among a cast of colorful characters: poets, artists, and even the homeless who found shelter within the stacks.

### The Charm of the Analog Era
The book captures the atmosphere of Paris between 1999 and 2000. It was a time before technology took over our lives—a time of postcards and payphones. Reading it felt like a beautiful trip down memory lane.
