**The past** cannot be changed. **The future** has yet to arrive. Only the **"present moment"** belongs to us—because it is the only thing we can still do something about.

"Mindfulness" is the tool that keeps us in the present. It could be said that the more mindful we are, the more we truly exist in our own lives.

"Self-awareness" is what gives birth to mindfulness. It is a skill that can be practiced. Without self-awareness, our minds will "drift"—either back to the past or away into the future.

### Just Observe Yourself

* If your heart feels **cloudy or resentful**, it means you are dwelling on the **past**.
* If your heart feels **anxious**, it means you are preoccupied with the **future**.

"Self-awareness" is just like any other skill—like mental math, sports, or public speaking. The more we do it, the more proficient we become.

Imagine if we practiced mental math for 10 hours every day for a year; we would undoubtedly become experts in mathematics.

In reality, many people *are* practicing a skill for 10 hours a day as well—but they are practicing the skill of **"mind-drifting."**

From the moment we wake up until we go to bed, we train our minds to be occupied with countless stories on Social Media. Some days, it's more than 10 hours. Consequently, we become "experts" at being distracted.

Some have been practicing this for over a year, leading to shorter attention spans and difficulty focusing. Which isn't surprising—after all, we’ve become experts at it, haven't we? :)

### Wouldn't it be better?
If, starting today, we chose to become experts in **"Building Self-Awareness"** instead?

* **Be aware** from the moment you wake up.
* **Reduce** the amount of external stimulation.
* **Close the screen** when it's not necessary.
* **Stay aware** until the moment you fall asleep.

At first, it might feel forced. But after many days, you will begin to master it, just like any other skill mentioned above.

The more **"Self-Awareness"** arises, the more **"Mindfulness"** is born. The more Mindfulness we have, the more we **Live in the Present**.

When we live in the present, "Life" truly becomes ours. :)
