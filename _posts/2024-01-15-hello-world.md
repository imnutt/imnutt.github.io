This is a sample post. Move your existing posts from `_posts/` into this theme's `_posts/` folder and they'll work automatically.

## Writing

Just write in Markdown. The theme stays out of your way.

```python
def hello():
    print("Hello, World")
```

> A blockquote looks like this.

Links work fine. Images work fine. Code blocks look clean.
