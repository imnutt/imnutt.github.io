title: "The minimum wage trap"

We need to stop pretending that the minimum wage is a safety net. In reality, it’s a **barrier to entry**.

For years, the political narrative has told us that raising the floor is the only way to protect the "little guy." But if we look at the mechanics of a truly free market, the minimum wage is actually a gatekeeper that locks the most vulnerable out of the economy.

### 1. The Disappearing Rung on the Ladder
Imagine a person whose current skill set generates roughly $5 worth of value per hour. If the law mandates a minimum wage of $15, that person is effectively **unemployable**. 

No rational employer—whether a massive corporation or a small family business—will pay $15 for $5 of output. By "protecting" them with a high minimum wage, we haven’t given them a raise; we’ve given them a **pink slip**. We’ve removed the first rung of the ladder, preventing them from gaining the on-the-job experience needed to eventually earn $20 or $30 an hour.

### 2. The Great Feedback Loop
The biggest myth in modern economics is that we can neatly divide society into "The Bosses" and "The Workers." 

In today’s world, **everyone is both.** * You are an **employee** when you clock in for your salary.
* You are an **employer** when you hire a freelancer, book a ride-share, or order food.

When you artificially inflate wages through legislation, you aren't just hitting a corporate bottom line; you are raising the cost of living for everyone. The worker gets a 10% raise, but the price of their lunch, commute, and rent goes up by 12% to cover the increased labor costs. It’s a zero-sum game that creates a "Working Poor" class who can't outrun inflation.

### 3. Let the Market Speak
A truly free market isn't about cruelty; it's about **honesty**. Prices, including the price of labor, are signals. 
* They tell workers which skills are in demand. 
* They tell employers where they can afford to expand. 

When the government intervenes, the signal is jammed. We end up with a surplus of people who can't find work and a shortage of affordable services for the middle class.

### 4. Sustainability Through Freedom
True sustainability doesn't come from government subsidies or "Negative Income Taxes" that recycle our own tax dollars back to us after taking a cut for bureaucracy. 

**Sustainability comes from the absence of barriers.** If we remove the legal red tape and the minimum wage floor, we allow the economy to breathe. We allow the person with $5-an-hour skills to get their foot in the door, learn, and grow. We allow small businesses to thrive without being crushed by mandates.

### The Bottom Line
If we want to improve the quality of life, we shouldn't be focused on a mandatory number on a paycheck. We should be focused on **lowering the cost of living** and **increasing the freedom to work.** The most "compassionate" thing a government can do for a worker is to stay out of the way.
