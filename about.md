Nutt (1981) · Bangkok, Thailand.

I started writing in 2021 to document my life — not for an audience, but for myself. Five years later, I'm still at it.

This site is a deliberate migration. I'm moving my most meaningful work here, leaving behind the clutter and keeping only what still holds up. Faster. Cleaner. Quieter.

No algorithms to chase. No metrics to watch. Just writing that matters to me, living somewhere it can breathe.

**Status:** Migrating the archives. Building the future.
